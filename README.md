In order to build the TypeScript compiler, ensure that you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) , [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [MongoDB] installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript.git
```

```bash
cd TypeScript
```

Install tools and dev dependencies:

```bash
npm install 
```

Use one of the following to build and test:

```
ts             # Build the compiler into built/local also watching for any change.
dev            # Start the app for development process.
start          # Build the compile into a product like directory.
```


## Usage

```bash
npm run start
```
